# learning_python
These are projects from Thinkful while I was learning Python.

All code was done in Google Colab so that tutors and graders from Thinkful could easily see projects and updates.

Here I practiced the following:

- Importing SLQ into python
- Importing Excel files into python
- Web scraping 
- Making API requests
- Using Pandas
- Manipulating Dataframes
